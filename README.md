This command tool utility creates playlists using Thundernerds Zworpshop and GTR API. I have plans to add a graphical interface and more functions in the future.
Currently Zworpshop and GTR are down. I am reformatting this script to be able to use either GTR/Zworpshop or SteamCMD and Steam API. This requires the user to input a steam API key so I'd rather not but it might give some more functionality in the end.

## How to install/use
Download the release version on the side. Place the *.exe file in your playlist folder at `%Appdata%\Zeepkist\Playlists`.
Placing it in its own folder in your playlist folder works and I prefer that to keep the playlists separate.

## Current functionality
- playlist with random tracks
- playlist from specific workshop id
- playlist from specific steamuser
- playlist with 30 from searchterm
- playlist with popular tracks (according to GTR)
- playlist with Hot tracks (according to GTR)
- playlist with most/least points (according to GTR)
