# ZeepkistRandomizer
In an effort to create a game-mode for Zeepkist similar to RMC (random map challenge) from Trackmania and to make creating playlists less cumbersome, I created this Python script. The script searches the steam workshop using BeautifulSoup4 and Thundernerds Zworpshop API.

## How to install/use
Download the release version on the side. Place the *.exe file in your playlist folder at `%Appdata%\Zeepkist\Playlists`.
Placing it in its own folder in your playlist folder works and I prefer that to keep the playlists separate.

## future version?
- create standalone *.exe with interface
- make a separate Bepinx RMC mod
    - timer
    - customizable rules
    - point counter
